			The other two, slight air and purging fire,<br>
Are both with thee, wherever I abide;<br>
The first my thought, the other my desire,<br>
These present-absent with swift motion slide.<br>
For when these quicker elements are gone<br>
In tender embassy of love to thee,<br>
My life, being made of four, with two alone<br>
Sinks down to death, oppressed with melancholy;<br>
Until life's composition be recured<br>
By those swift messengers return'd from thee,<br>
Who even but now come back again, assured<br>
Of thy fair health, recounting it to me:<br>
   This told, I joy; but then no longer glad,<br>
   I send them back again and straight grow sad.
